## Bio

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer, and maintain several research-orientated open-source R packages including [`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis) and [`medrxivr`](https://github.com/ropensci/medrxivr), in addition to some smaller utility/learning packages (e.g. [wordcountaddin](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin) and [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/pathformatr)).

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running, [LEGO](https://mcguinlu.netlify.app/2021/02/02/baby-yoda-in-r/) and really terrible movies.
