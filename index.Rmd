## Bio

I am an NIHR Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Bristol Medical School, where I use large electronic health record (EHR) databases and evidence synthesis methods to examine the relationship between blood lipid levels and dementia risk. 

I am an enthusiastic R user/developer and maintain several research-orientated open-source R packages including [`robvis`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis) and [`medrxivr`](https://github.com/ropensci/medrxivr), in addition to some smaller utility/learning packages (e.g. [`pathformatr`](https://github.com/mcguinlu/pathformatr)).

Outside of work, I am an avid fan of running, LEGO and really terrible movies.
