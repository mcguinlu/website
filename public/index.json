Conducting and updating of systematic reviews is time-consuming. In practice, data extraction is one of the most complex tasks in this process. Exponential improvements in computational processing speed and data storage are fostering the development of data extraction models and algorithms. This, in combination with quicker pathways to publication, led to a large landscape of tools and methods for data extraction tasks. Objective: To review published methods and tools for data extraction to (semi)automate the systematic reviewing process. Methods: We propose to conduct a living review. With this methodology we aim to do monthly search updates, as well as bi-annual review updates if new evidence permits it. In a cross-sectional analysis we will extract methodological characteristics and assess the quality of reporting in our included papers. Conclusions: We aim to increase transparency in the reporting and assessment of machine learning technologies to the benefit of data scientists, systematic reviewers and funders of health research. This living review will help to reduce duplicate efforts by data scientists who develop data extraction methods. It will also serve to inform systematic reviewers about possibilities to support their data extraction.","tags":["Living-review"],"title":"Data extraction methods for systematic review (semi)automation: A living review protocol [version 1]","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585090800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585090800,"objectID":"585701341c67e9db4f9e8fe2246ead89","permalink":"/project/abcd/","publishdate":"2020-03-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/abcd/","section":"project","summary":"Create Acyclic Behavior Change Diagrams using Shiny.","tags":["All","App","Visualisation"],"title":"ABCD (Acyclic Behavior Change Diagrams)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Nakagawa S","Dunn AG","Lagisz M","Bannach-Brown A","Grames EM","Sanchez-Tojar A","Rose E","O’Dea RE","Noble DWA","Westgate MJ","Arnold PA","Barrow S","Bethel A","Cooper E","Foo YZ","Geange SR","Hennessy E","Mapanga W","Mengersen K","Munera C","Page MJ","Welch V","**Evidence Synthesis Hackathon 2019 Participants**","Haddaway NR [*as a member of the Synthesis Hackathon 2019*]"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584921600,"objectID":"32f2b0c423b9d860b86df2e8212e9c19","permalink":"/publication/nakagawa2020anewecosystem/nakagawa2020anewecosystem/","publishdate":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakagawa2020anewecosystem/nakagawa2020anewecosystem/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthesizing evidence is an essential part of scientific progress, but it is often done in a slow and uncoordinated manner, sometimes producing misleading conclusions.

Get Stata and R working well together\rMy initial approach was to set up a RStudio project, and rearrange the scripts and data I had received into a familiar structure:\n.\r+-- code\r| +-- .do files\r| +-- .R scripts\r+-- data\r+-- output\r+-- reports\r+-- manuscript\r+-- supplement\r+-- Config - STATA.do # Configuration file for Stata\r+-- Config - R.R # Configuration file for R\rThe previous owner of the project had set up a configuration file for both Stata and R, which when run, would source the relevant .do files and .R scripts from the code folder in the correct order.\nFor example, the Config - STATA.do file set the necessary global paths and then ran a series of .do files to process the raw data, generate the basic cohort, add covariates, calculate summary statistics for the cohort, calculate the frequency of missing data for each important covariate, and then finally perform the analysis of interest:\n\n# Config - STATA.do\r* Set global paths -----------------------------------------------------------\rglobal path \u0026quot;path/to/project/folder\u0026quot;\rglobal dofiles \u0026quot;$path/code\u0026quot;\rglobal output \u0026quot;$path/output\u0026quot;\rglobal data \u0026quot;$path/data\u0026quot;\r* Run dictionary -------------------------------------------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/codedict.do\u0026quot;\r* Generate cohort ------------------------------------------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/cohort2.do\u0026quot;\r* Add covariates (Note: cov.do requires cov_*.do) ----------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/cov2.do\u0026quot;\r* Generate data for Table 1 --------------------------------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/toc.do\u0026quot;\r* Generate data on missing covariate information -----------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/missingdata.do\u0026quot;\r* Run Cox regression analysis ------------------------------------------------\rrun \u0026quot;$dofiles/analysis2.do\u0026quot;\rSimilarly , the Config - R.R file loaded the necessary libraries and then sourced the scripts to build the three plots.\n\n# Config- R.R\r# Setup ======================================================================\rlibrary(ggplot2)\r# Plot analysis results ======================================================\rsource(\u0026quot;code/plot_cohort2_attrition.R\u0026quot;)\rsource(\u0026quot;code/plot_main_forest_plots.R\u0026quot;)\rsource(\u0026quot;code/plot_age_forest_plots.R\u0026quot;)\rTo begin with, I would run each of these files seperately, one after the other, which worked perfectly but ran against my aim of being able to run the whole project with a single command.\nTo begin to address this, I created a new master.R script which would call both the Config - STATA.do and the Config - R.R files. The dependency tree for the new set-up looked like this:\nmaster.R\r+-- Config - STATA.do\r| +-- code\r| | +-- .do files\r+-- Config - R.R\r| +-- code\r| | +-- .R scripts\rTo call Stata from R, I used the RStata package, built by Luca Braglia, which allows users to execute Stata commands (both inline and from a .do file) from within R itself (the name is a bit of a give-away). You just need to provide the path to your .do file, the path to your Stata executable (stata.path), the version of Stata you have (stata.version) and whether you want to print Stata text output to the console (stata.echo) as arguments.\n\n# master.R - Version 1\r# Analysis ===================================================================\rRStata::stata(\u0026quot;Config - Stata.do\u0026quot;,\rstata.path = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;A:\\\\Stata\\\\Stata15_MP\\\\StataMP-64\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\rstata.version = 15,\rstata.echo = TRUE)\r# Plotting ===================================================================\rsource(\u0026quot;Config - R.R\u0026quot;)\r\nA note on network drives\rI initially ran into some issues in using RStata as I couldn’t get it to find where the Stata executable was stored.\nIn Bristol, Stata is kept on a network drive (\\\\ads.bris.ac.uk\\) which I was pretty sure was the root of the problem. After a lot of reading, an indirect fix came from this answer to a SlackOverflow question on why a rmarkdown file would not knit on a network drive.\nEssentially, it turns out that R isn’t great at dealing with arbitrary URIs for shared network drives, and so mapping the network drive to a local lettered drive in the Windows File Explorer sorted it out. You just need to remember to update the path in the Config - STATA.do, to replace the \\\\ads.bris.ac.uk\\ portion with the corresponding letter:\n# Fix issue with network drives\r# Replace RStata::stata(\u0026quot;Config - Stata.do\u0026quot;,\rstata.path = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;\\\\ads.bris.ac.uk\\\\path\\\\to\\\\stata\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, #\rstata.version = 15,\rstata.echo = TRUE)\r# with\rRStata::stata(\u0026quot;Config - Stata.do\u0026quot;,\rstata.path = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;A:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\stata\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, # stata.version = 15,\rstata.echo = TRUE)\r\r\r\rAim #2. Send a notification to my phone when a long running Stata script is complete.\rFor some of the analysis performed, running the Config - STATA.do file would take \u0026gt;4 hours. In this case, I thought it would be useful to have someway of the script telling me that it was finished, so I could go out and have a walk/coffee or work on other things without feeling the need to constantly check on the progress.\nTo achieve this, I used the pushoverr package, which allows you to send notifications to the pushover app on your phone via R. I found this blogpost by Brian Connelly very helpful when getting started with pushoverr.\nThe only downside to Pushover as a system is that after a 7 day trial period, there is a cost of ~£4 to activate the app fully - but personally I think it’s worth it!\nSo having added pushoverr, my master.R file now looked like this:\n\n# master.R - Version 2\r# Analysis ===================================================================\rRStata::stata(\u0026quot;Config - Stata.do\u0026quot;,\rstata.path = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;A:\\\\Stata\\\\Stata15_MP\\\\StataMP-64\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\rstata.version = 15,\rstata.echo = TRUE)\rpushoverr::pushover(message = \u0026#39;Analysis complete.\u0026#39;)\r# Plotting ===================================================================\rsource(\u0026quot;Config - R.R\u0026quot;)\rpushoverr::pushover(message=\u0026#39;Plotting complete.\u0026#39;)\rBy this point, I was cresting the “Peak of inflated expectations” and was feeling very pleased with myself. It didn’t last very long however adue to one important limitation of the RStata package . . .\n\nError handling\rWhile the RStata package is great, one area where it fell down significantly was in how it handles Stata errors - put simply, it doesn’t handle them at all. It prints the resulting error message to the console but crucially does not prevent the rest of the R script from running. In practice, this meant in the master.R file above, if Stata encountered an error when executing the Config - STATA.do file, pushoverr would still send me the “Analysis complete” message. Not good.\nThis was particularly problematic in this specific project, as the R scripts to produce the plots depend directly on the outputs produced by the analysis. Therefore, if the Config - STATA.do step fails but the rest of the R script runs, the resulting graphs will be based on obsolete/incorrect data.\nIn order to solve this, I added the following line to the Config - STATA.do file, right at the end:\n# Add to the very end of \u0026#39;Config - STATA.do\u0026#39;\rclear\rset obs 0\rgen pushover = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rsave \u0026quot;$path/pushover.dta\u0026quot;\rThis saves an empty “indicator” Stata dataset (pushover.dta) in the top level folder, which you can then use with file.exist() to confirm that the Config - STATA.do file ran all the way through and did not produce any errors.\nI combined this with a pushoverr so that it would now send me a message telling me whether the analysis had completed successdully or had errored. This resulted in some additional changes to my master.R file looked, which now looked something like this:\n\n# master.R - Version 3\r# Setup ======================================================================\rsource(\u0026quot;code/pushover.R\u0026quot;)\rpush_clean() # Remove pushoverr indicator file\r# Analysis ===================================================================\rRStata::stata(\u0026quot;Config - Stata.do\u0026quot;,\rstata.path = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;A:\\\\Stata\\\\Stata15_MP\\\\StataMP-64\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\rstata.version = 15,\rstata.echo = TRUE)\rpush_analysis() # Send pushoverr notification to phone on analysis status\r# Plot main analysis results =================================================\rsource(\u0026quot;Config - R.R\u0026quot;)\rpush_plotting() # Send pushoverr notification to phone on plotting status\rThe pushover.R file contains the three push_*() functions seen in master.R above:\n#pushover.R\rpush_clean \u0026lt;- function() {\rtry(file.remove(\u0026quot;pushover.dta\u0026quot;))\r}\rpush_analysis \u0026lt;- function() {\rif (file.exists(\u0026quot;pushover.dta\u0026quot;) == TRUE) {\rpushoverr::pushover(message = \u0026#39;Analysis complete.\u0026#39;)\r} else{\rpushoverr::pushover(message = \u0026#39;Analysis errored.\u0026#39;)\r}\rfile.remove(\u0026quot;pushover.dta\u0026quot;)\r}\rpush_plotting \u0026lt;- function() {\rpushoverr::pushover(message=\u0026#39;Plotting complete.\u0026#39;)\r}\rTo elaborate on the purpose of these functions:\n\rpush_clean(): ensures the indicator file does not already exist in the top level folder and removes it if it does.\rpush_analysis(): checks whether the indicator file exists. If it does, pushoverr sends a message saying the analysis was a success. If it doesn’t, a message saying the analysis errored is sent instead.\rpush_plotting(): this was written mainly to save me typing the same pushoverr command over and over\r\r\n\rA note on reproducibility\rI was showing this set-up to a colleague who asked why I needed a master.R file at all, in other words why not just have the Config - R.R file call Stata and send the pushoverr notifications?\nThe primary reason for this is that it is an effort to lower the effort required to reproduce the analysis. Both master.R and pushover.R were added to .gitignore and do not appear in the GitHub repo for this project. This removes the need for users to try and set-up RStata and pushoverr by encouraging them to run the Config files themselves in sequence.\nThis is the best set-up I found that maximises my efficient when developing the project but also maintains the ease of reproducibility by removing dependencies on hard-to-configure packages.\n\r\r\rFinal word\rI had a look on Twitter to see if there were any other methods people used to signify that a script was complete and came across this tweet from Anna Kautto:\nToday I made my R script say “I have the answer to the great question though I dont think you are going to like it” out loud after finishing calculating. #rstats #deepthought #glmer #phdchat\r— Anna Kautto (@annakau) November 11, 2019\r\r\rWhile I think the idea of my computer unexpectedly talking to me would likely make me jump and spill tea everywhere, I love the idea and may update the content of my pushoverr notifications to something a bit more fun!\n\r","date":1573171200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573171200,"objectID":"9b1d6d7d23dd78876befb4bd5d9ba62c","permalink":"/post/using-stata-r-and-pushoverr/","publishdate":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/using-stata-r-and-pushoverr/","section":"post","summary":"I recently took over a project that made use of Stata to perform the analysis and subsequently used R to create plots of the results.\nInspired by this blogpost from Frederick Solt, I wanted to see if I could set up my project to run start-to-finish from a single script (i.e. could I call Stata efficiently from R to perform the analysis, and then immediately use R to plot the results?","tags":[],"title":"Using Stata in R with {RStata} and {pushoverr}","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yao I","Dawson S","Higgins JPT","**McGuinness LA**","McAleenan A","Kurian K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569884400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569884400,"objectID":"e750b57363be21e2d68ba6637e9089fe","permalink":"/publication/yao2019effectiveness/yao2019effectiveness/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yao2019effectiveness/yao2019effectiveness/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: BRAF inhibitor treatment with vemurafenib and dabrafenib have produced significant increases in median overall survival for BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma patients and are in wide clinical use.

As the most widely used (largely) illegal substance in Western countries this may be an important public health concern. We aim to systematically review the evidence on the association between cannabis use and TB (latent infection and active disease) to inform ongoing and future TB prevention and control strategies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review. We searched Ovid Medline, Embase and PsycInfo, together with the World Health Organization website and Google Scholar, for all years to January 2018. Reference lists and conference abstracts were hand-searched, a forward citation search was conducted on the Web of Science, and experts were contacted. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using an adapted version of ROBINS-I (“Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies – of Interventions”). Data were narratively synthesised. Results: Of 377 records identified, 11 studies were eligible. Study designs were heterogeneous. Six studies utilised a relevant comparator group. Four of these investigated the association between cannabis use and latent TB infection; all provided some evidence of an association, although only two of these had adjusted for confounders. The remaining two comparator studies investigated the association between cannabis use and active TB disease; neither found evidence of an association after adjusting for confounding. All six studies were at “Serious” risk of bias. The five studies which did not utilise a relevant comparator group were all indicative of TB outbreaks occurring among cannabis users, but the quality of the evidence was very weak. Conclusions:Evidence for an association between cannabis use and TB acquisition is weak.

Systematic reviews evaluating the effects of complex health interventions can be challenging to conduct. This paper is part of a special series of papers considering these challenges particularly in the context of WHO guideline development. We outline established and innovative methods for synthesising quantitative evidence within a systematic review of a complex intervention, including considerations of the complexity of the system into which the intervention is introduced. We describe methods in three broad areas: non-quantitative approaches, including tabulation, narrative and graphical approaches; standard meta-analysis methods, including meta-regression to investigate study-level moderators of effect; and advanced synthesis methods, in which models allow exploration of intervention components, investigation of both moderators and mediators, examination of mechanisms, and exploration of complexities of the system. We offer guidance on the choice of approach that might be taken by people collating evidence in support of guideline development, and emphasise that the appropriate methods will depend on the purpose of the synthesis, the similarity of the studies included in the review, the level of detail available from the studies, the nature of the results reported in the studies, the expertise of the synthesis team and the resources available.","tags":["Methods"],"title":"Synthesising quantitative evidence in systematic reviews of complex health interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**McGuinness LA**","Warren‐Gash C","Moorhouse LR","Thomas SL"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548115200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548115200,"objectID":"a16bb8021f3d7b363fead288dc1f17d9","permalink":"/publication/mcguinness2019validity/mcguinness2019validity/","publishdate":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcguinness2019validity/mcguinness2019validity/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: The purpose of the study is to assess the validity of codes or algorithms used to identify dementia in UK electronic health record (EHR) primary care and hospitalisation databases. Methods: Relevant studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE/EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018, hand‐searching reference lists, and consulting experts. The search strategy included synonyms for “Dementia”, “Europe”, and “EHR”. Studies were included if they validated dementia diagnoses in UK primary care or hospitalisation databases, irrespective of validation method used. The Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results: From 1469 unique records, 14 relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value (PPV), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and 0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively. One study performed a rate comparison, indicating good generalisability of dementia diagnoses in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to the UK population. Studies were of low methodological quality. As studies were not comparable, no summary validity estimates were produced. Conclusion: While heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across studies. Future validation studies should make use of more robust reference tests, follow established reporting guidelines, and calculate all measures of validity.","tags":["Systematic-review","Dementia"],"title":"The validity of dementia diagnoses in routinely collected electronic health records in the United Kingdom; a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**McGuinness LA**","Higgins JPT","Sterne JAC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538348400,"objectID":"7cdd0c3bdf80d57104f7f777ed395af5","permalink":"/publication/mcguinness2018assessing/mcguinness2018assessing/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mcguinness2018assessing/mcguinness2018assessing/","section":"publication","summary":"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are widely accepted as the gold standard in the assessment of health interventions. However, evidence from RCTs is often unavailable. Randomized clinical trials may also be impractical, for example when the outcome of interest is so rare or so long term that appropriately sized studies would be too expensive. In addition, RCTs require clinical equipoise, and withholding established treatments may be considered unethical even if evidence for the effects of these treatments is limited. Finally, RCTs may be underway but not ready for reporting for some years.","tags":["Bias","Commentary"],"title":"Assessing the credibility of non-randomised studies of interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537268400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537268400,"objectID":"f78e1126fdd06641e503d1a142eceff8","permalink":"/talk/talk-3/","publishdate":"2018-09-18T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-3/","section":"talk","summary":"Non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) can provide useful data on the effects of healthcare interventions but are likely to be subject to confounding and other biases, some of which do not apply to trials.

However, the optimal management of those with moderate and severe alcohol dependence in primary and community care after detoxification remains unclear. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for maintaining abstinence in people with alcohol dependence following detoxification. Methods: We will systematically search electronic databases and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness of pharmacological and/or psychosocial interventions for maintaining abstinence in recently detoxified, alcohol-dependent adults. The searches will be complemented by checking references and citations from included studies and other relevant systematic reviews. No limitation on language, year, or publication status will be applied. RCTs will be selected using prespecified criteria. Descriptive information, study characteristics, and results of eligible RCTs will be extracted. A revised version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) will be used to assess the risk of bias in eligible RCTs. Results will be synthesized and analyzed using network meta-analysis (NMA). Overall strength of the evidence and publication bias will be evaluated. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis will also be performed. Discussion: This network meta-analysis aims to appraise and summarize the total evidence of therapeutic interventions for alcohol-dependent patients that require support for detoxification and can be treated in the community. The evidence will determine which combination of interventions are most promising for current practice and further investigation.","tags":["Systematic-review","Protocol"],"title":"Therapeutic interventions for alcohol dependence in non-inpatient settings; a systematic review and network meta-analysis (protocol)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"e6a43453485d81af0ef84a7009ac5c22","permalink":"/project/robvis/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/robvis/","section":"project","summary":"A Shiny web app to create risk-of-bias visualisations.","tags":["All","App","Visualisation"],"title":"robvis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
