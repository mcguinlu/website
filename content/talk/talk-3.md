abstract = "Non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) can provide useful data on the effects of healthcare interventions but are likely to be subject to confounding and other biases, some of which do not apply to trials. The ROBINS-I (risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions) tool provides a comprehensive assessment of risk of bias in NRSI, facilitating their inclusion in robust systematic reviews. Here, I present and describe the features of an online implementation of the ROBINS-I tool."
